# psychopy-legacy-mic

Extension that enables audio capture and analysis using Pyo.

This is the 'legacy' microphone library originally written by Jeremy R. Gray that was originally found in 
`psychopy.microphone`. This library provides advanced, but rarely used features. It has since been deprecated and 
replaced by the newer Psychtoolbox based microphone library in `psychopy.sound.microphone`.

Some features may no longer work as the library has not been maintained for some time. Depends on the `psychopy-pyo`
extension package.
    
## Installing

Install this package with the following shell commands:: 
    
    pip install psychopy-pyo 
    pip install psychopy-legacy-mic

You may also use PsychoPy's builtin package manager to install this package.

## Usage

Once the package is installed, PsychoPy will automatically load it when started and make objects available within the
`psychopy.microphone` namespace.
